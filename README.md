# Computational Physics

Folder for files for FYS3150/4150 Computational Physics at University of Oslo Fall 2021. Code written in C++ and plotting code in Python. 
The code for each project is located in their respective folders, with full scientific reports for Project 3-5.

### [Project 1](project1/):

Numerical solution to the one-dimensional Poisson equation by converting the second derivative to a solvable matrix equation Av = g.

### [Project 2](project2/):
Numerical solution of an eigenvalue problem exemplified by a special case of the one-dimensional buckling beam.

### [Project 3](project3/):
Simulation of a Penning trap which confines charged particles using static electric and magnetic fields.

### [Project 4](project4/):
Simulation of the Ising model in two dimensions to explore temperature-dependent behaviour in ferromagnets and numerically estimate the critical temperature at which the system undergoes a phase transition (from magnetized phase to a phase with no net magnetization).

### [Project 5](project5/): 
Simulation of the two dimensional time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation to study a double-slit-in-a-box setup and variations thereof.
